# giftastic

Holy Moly, getting the first parts of this to work were easy, but the little fiddly bits were more complex than I aniticpated. 

The app works by clicking the buttons gennerated at the top of the screen. When a button is clicked it produces gifs connected with the word on the button. 

The user can also select favorites by double clicking thier favorite gifs. they will then appear in the side favorite box. They will stay until the browser history is cleared. I tried to do a splice meathod to earase them from the favorite box, but I ran out of time and patience.
